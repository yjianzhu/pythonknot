  KNOT.H
   By Bob Jenkins, 1988.  Public Domain.
   A file describing a legal knot consists of
   1: how many strings,
       2: for each string, how many crossings, then
           3: for each crossing, the cross name, then 1 if over, -1 if under
   4: for each crossing, the name of the crossing and 1 if right, -1 if left.
   The spacing and placement of returns don't matter.  Integers only.
   If there are n crossings, they must be named 0..n-1.
   Example:  Two rubber bands, one on top of the other, would be:
   2

   4
   0  1   1  1   2  1   3  1
   4
   0 -1   1 -1   2 -1   3 -1

   0 -1
   1  1
   2 -1
   3  1
